      I started to be able to make a static web page that is reponsive.<br />
      I began from creating a hamburger menu.

      Once I have learnt how to create a static and responsive web page, I have

      It took me another while to implement those format into my actual
      portfolio.<br />
      Still, I have constantly tried to accommodate what I have learnt and I
      have finally implemented into my portfolio case.

    <h2 class="nextup">Next Up</h2>
    <p class="nextupdescription">
      I am currently planning to implement the following card slide to "Insight"
      part of my portfolio.<br />
      Ever since I have been able to create a card slide in a separate HTML
      document, I wanted to copy the code and paste it in my original portfolio.
      Unfortunately, I have realized that it was not going to work the way I
      wanted it to be because the coding for the original portfolio files that I
      have did not seem to be compatible to how I created the card slide.<br/<br />
      Having said that, I am going to gradually transfer the codes from my
      original portfolio to the card slide to see if I can implement it
      properly.
